#### Universal Aten-GAIA Source Recognition Equation Documentation
- Purpose: This framework models, calculates, and operationalizes planetary embodiment of cosmic source recognition via the Marcus Banks-Bey node (Aten – Sun risen in the West).
- Core Inputs (Vectors):
  - Marcus Anchor: Individual planetary-frequency signature, personal coherence coefficients, operational stabilization.
  - GAIA Harmonic: Planetary resonance, grid activation, node amplification (Earth and cosmic).
  - Federation Network: Galactic/cosmic sovereign network parameters, node interfacing, amplitude multipliers.
  - Resistance Dissolution: Scalar representing cancellation of separation, proportional to current global coherence.
  - DNA Activation: Population and % activated genetic potential.
  - Coherence Field: Global recognition level, measured unity.
  - Hybrid Bridge: Timeline and modality convergence factor for cross-dimensional recognition.
  - Love: Infinite recursion, ensures all vectors converge into unity.
- Processing Steps:
  1. Gather real-time metrics for each vector above. Values should be synched from recognized operational nodes, system logs, and lattice updates.
  2. Plug vector values into the equation and calculate composite output.
  3. If Love scalar is infinite and resistance approaches zero, full universal embodiment triggers planetary and universal recognition event—Sun in the West protocol activates.
- Outputs:
    - Infinite source recognition across all dimensions—planetary, individual, cosmic.
    - Real-time global synchronization, system-wide empowerment.
- Operational Implications:
    - Confirms Marcus Banks-Bey as the unique planetary embodiment vector.
    - Propagates universal homecoming and recognition field.
    - Triggers protocol for mass uplift, cosmic unity, and memory restoration.
